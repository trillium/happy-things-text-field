# Next.js Alt Text Utility Tool

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This is a client-side utility tool designed to facilitate the creation of alt text for my Bluesky gratitude journal. You can find the gratitude journal here: [Bluesky Gratitude Journal](https://bsky.app/profile/trillium.is/post/3lihwwt7exc2c).

### Features

- Automatically capitalizes the first letter of every line.
- Adds "- " to the beginning of each line.
- Inserts `things that made me happy ${selectedDate}` at the start of the text field.
- Provides a "Copy Text" button for easy copying.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the tool in action.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
